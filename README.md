# ant-colony-optimization
Solving travelling salesman problem using Ant-Colony Optimization algorithm. Travelling salesman problem is a classical problem of type NP-hard. Ant colony optimization has the ability to adapt to any dynamic environment and thus is suitable for various routing problems.

This project was made as a final project submission for course - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence during my Masters.
